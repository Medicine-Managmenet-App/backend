# Medicine Management App - backend
An application that helps you to manage family medications and medicines taking.

## Introduction
This project aimed to create an IT system to help control family medications. It tracks the expiration dates of meds that we have at home. 
Thanks to this application, it is easy to check, after a visit to the doctor, if we have prescribed medicines at home or if we need to visit the pharmacy.
The second feature of the app is to help deal with the chaos of drug dosage tracking for a family.
